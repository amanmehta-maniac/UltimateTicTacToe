# UltimateTicTacToe
A 4x4x4 ultimate tic tac toe bot built using Artificial Intelligence. The bot is capable of taking decisions by considering several steps in future. During the end, it even goes to ~100 steps to the future. I wish you good luck defeating this bot! ;) 

Requirements: 
1. python

How to play:
1. change player1 and player2 in simulator2.py. (Also import the required py files)
2. If you want to play manually against our bot: set P1 or P2 as team84.py and set mode of game to human vs computer.
3. run simulator2.py (python simulator2.py <with correct corresponding flags>)

Get ready to lose to our bot! ;)
